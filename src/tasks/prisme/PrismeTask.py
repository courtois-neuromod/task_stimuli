    # - Task loops

    # @note
    # The core of the software architecture is designed as a general main loop,
    # processing task and events bits by bits.
    # Any yield within the underlying sub-loops gives back software's control
    # to the main loop, thus letting inputs (such as. <ctrl>-C) be processed.
    # Once the main loop has finished its temporary job, it gives back control
    # to the python method (generator). It also record a movie frame every 6th
    # yield if --record-movie is enabled.

    # 1st task loop
    # `Awaiting` task loop, to be displayed while awaiting fmri TTL to be sent
    # (in case flag --fmri is on), before eyetracker has started recording,
    # before EEG TTL has been sent, etc etc.
    #
    # @warning
    # Other instructions such as eyetracking may already have been displayed.
    # @warning
    # Main loop seems not to contain any sleep to wait inbetween frame so
    # it's likely all frames will be run at once, and event will be
    # ignored until next frame is yield.
    # @note main loop doesn't rely on generator argument, but Task
    # (base_task) use it in order to know if it has to clear the buffer
    # after (when True) displaying the frame (by flipping the backbuffer), but
    # only when using #_instructions instead of #instructions.
